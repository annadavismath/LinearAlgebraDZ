\section*{About this Project}

\subsection*{About this Text}
This is the third edition of \emph{Linear Algebra, An Interactive Introduction}.  The \href{https://ximera.osu.edu/la/LinearAlgebra}{first edition} (2018) was funded by the Ohio Open Ed Collaborative (OOEC) through the Ohio Department of Higher Education Innovation grant. The \href{https://ximera.osu.edu/oerlinalg}{second edition} (2023) was made possible by Fall 2022 sabbatical leaves granted to Anna Davis and Paul Zachlin by Ohio Dominican University, and Lakeland Community College, respectively.

This edition contains significant updates to content, as well as formative assessments.  We have added different types of chapter review exercises, Octave exercises, and included an Octave tutorial with links to sample code.  This phase of the project was funded by the \href{https://github.com/XimeraProject}{Ximera Project} through the \href{https://www2.ed.gov/programs/otp/index.html}{Open Textbook Pilot Program} grant (2024-2026).

We have taken care to ensure these materials satisfy the \href{https://dam.assets.ohio.gov/image/upload/transfercredit.ohio.gov/files/transfer/tags/course-descriptions/OMT/OMT019-_ELEMENTARY_LINEAR_ALGEBRA.pdf}{Ohio Transfer Assurance Guidelines}  for a first course in Linear Algebra, as well as the recommendations for a first course in linear algebra made by \href{https://dx.doi.org/10.1090/noti2479}{The Linear Algebra Curriculum Study Group (LACSG 2.0)}.

\subsection*{Acknowledgements}
\begin{itemize}
\item
We would like to thank our reviewers Jim Fowler of Ohio State University and Jim Cottrill of Ohio Dominican University for their thoughtful comments and suggestions regarding the first edition.  
\item This project would not have been possible without the XIMERA platform.  Many thanks go to Bart Snapp and Jim Fowler of Ohio State University for their continued guidance and support.   
\item We would also like to thank Wim Obbels of KU Leuven, Belgium, for sharing his expertise in formatting and deploying Ximera documents.
\item We are also grateful to Steven Valvoda for his careful reading and editing.
\item Our inspiration and some of our content came from other open textbooks. We would like to thank Keith Nicholson and Ken Kuttler for making their texts available under a Creative Commons license.  Since one of the authors taught Linear Algebra using the excellent book by David Poole for fifteen years, that text has most certainly influenced our work as well.

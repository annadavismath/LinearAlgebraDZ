\section*{Least Squares}

The templates in this section provide code samples for implementing the least squares method. You can access our Octave code through the link at the bottom of each template.  Feel free to modify the code and experiment to learn more!  Alternatively, go to the \href{https://sagecell.sagemath.org/}{Sage Math Cell Webpage}, copy the code below into the cell, select OCTAVE as the language, and press EVALUATE.  

%When implementing least squares by hand, you probably utilize the process established by the following theorem.
